The Airline Price Prediction project is designed to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict airline ticket prices based on various factors.By analyzing features such as travel dates, destination, airline carrier, and historical pricing data, the model can provide travelers and airlines with valuable insights into fare trends. This project aims to assist travelers in making informed decisions while also helping airlines optimize their pricing strategies for improved revenue management.The code and resources provided in this repository allow users to train the prediction model and deploy it for real-time fare predictions.
